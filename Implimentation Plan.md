# ChemPath Project Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup & Basic Data Population
1. Database Foundation
   - ~~Set up test Neo4j instance with sample data~~
   - ~~Create basic compound nodes (start with 10-15 common compounds)~~
   - ~~Add simple reaction relationships between compounds~~
   - ~~Test basic graph traversal queries~~

2. Core API Implementation
   - ~~Create CRUD endpoints for compounds~~
   - ~~Create CRUD endpoints for reactions~~
   - ~~Add basic error handling and logging~~
   - Write API tests for each endpoint

3. Basic Pathfinding Implementation
   - ~~Implement simple depth-first search algorithm~~
   - ~~Add basic path validation~~
   - ~~Create endpoint to find single path between compounds~~
   - Add tests for pathfinding logic
